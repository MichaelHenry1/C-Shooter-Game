A player that walks around a map with a weapon

weapon has infinite ammo and never reloads

weapon needs to move around with the player

weapon needs a bullet and movement

while weapon is shooting it will make shooting sounds 

weapon is going to aim with the mouse in any direction

weapon cant spray non-stop, it can only shoot one by one by clicking the mouse repeatedly

the bullet will have to collide with the enemy to count as a hit

as soon as it collides it will be destroyed so it doesn't go through the enemy

the range will be as far as the camera can see and if it is out of the camera, it will be destroyed 

The weapon will start at 1 damage as default and the max upgrade is up 5 damage

Enemies that spawn randomly and the player can kill them to get coins

when the enemy is completely killed then it will give you the coins 

there will be text at the top-left corner showing the amount of coins
shop:
There will be an UPGRADES bar and when you click on it, it will open a window within the window and it will have upgrades such as, ADD 1 Damage to your weapon or ADD 1 extra coin to "Enemy" 

The only upgrades there will be are the ones listed above, but I might add more later 

There will be three kinds of enemies, each one giving a little more coins

the smallest enemy will give you 3 coins, but you can upgrade it up to 5 coins at max and it will spawn every 3 seconds at a random spot every time it is generated, each one will have 5 health

the medium sized one will give you 8 coins, you can upgrade it up to 10 coins at max and it will spawn every 6 seconds at a random spot, each one will have 10 health

the biggest one will give you 15 coins, you can upgrade it up to 20 coins at max and it will spawn every 15 seconds at a random spot, it wil have 20 health
